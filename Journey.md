# Writing the morris code program with Rust

## First steps

I know I need a "table" that translates ASCII to Morris Code, so I went with a HashMap, where the key is the ASCII character and the value is the dashes and dots. 

Before branching out into the world of crates and separate files I put everything in one file to start with. The first iteration just loads the map and prints out two hard coded values.

The `morris_code_table` is a Vec of String types. Why? Because neither the value nor the keys will need to be changed. 

Added four tests, because that exactly what should be done.

## Step Two ‚Äì Splitting things up

That all works. Now I want to split the `morris_code_table` to it‚Äôs own crate. My thinking is to create a file called models.rs to house ‚Äúmodeled‚Äù data, like the Morris Code Table. In order to do that I create a lib.rs and add `pub mod models;`. Next I move the HashMap table to models.rs making sure I give it the proper visibility. Then I add the following to main.rs.

```rust
pub mod models;

use crate::models::morris_code::morris_code_table;
```

Running `cargo test` reveals good things!

```bash
‚ùØ cargo run
